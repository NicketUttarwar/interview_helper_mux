"""Hand-derived stage dependency data, merged into contracts by the generator.

`tools/bootstrap_stage_contracts.py` **overwrites** every
`docs/cross-cutting/stage-contracts/*.yaml` on each run, and it runs as step 1 of
`scripts/verify_artifact_contract.sh`. Anything hand-edited into a contract file
is therefore reverted on the next verify. So the dependency data of plan §4.3
lives here, in the generator's input, and the YAML stays generated.

Organised by operator phase (`interview_mux.v2.phases`) because plan §3.3
populates upstream-first, one group at a time.

## Safety rule for `hard` vs `soft`

Contract `inputs` are **not** inert, contrary to plan §3.4 which claims
`inputs[].producer` is the only live lever. `artifact_lifecycle.run_phase_checks`
walks `contract.inputs`, and for every **hard** dep whose `when` holds it emits
`missing input <path> for <stage>` at `PRESTAGE` and runs `read_stale_guard`
against it. A wrongly-hard dep therefore gates a live stage — the same hazard as
`sufficiency`.

So while contracts are being populated:

* a dep is **hard** only when the stage body already refuses without it
  (`ctx.artifact_exists_required(...)`, or an unconditional read that raises);
* every other real dep is **soft**, which nothing live consumes;
* `producer` is set on both, and the `requires` edges it mints are gated by
  `MUX_CONTRACT_REQUIRES` (`artifact_dependency_graph`).

A soft row may additionally carry `correctness: true`. That marker is read by
`ship_reachability` alone — everything on the dispatch path filters on `hard` —
and it means the master would be *wrong* without the artifact even though the
stage body does not refuse. Justify one the same way hardness is justified: name
the code that degrades silently in its absence.

Evidence for each entry: `tools/extract_stage_artifact_touches.py` over the
stage's entrypoint module, cross-checked against `web/stages.py::STAGE_BY_ID`
(the promotion allowlist `flush_stage_writes` uses) and the guardrail tables in
`artifact_dependency_graph._PROPAGATION_SEEDS` / `stage_completion`.

# `inputs[].producer` is what mints a `requires` edge, so a guessed producer
# routes a heal to a stage that can only be denied — the inverse of the

#      rest are mutators (`master/selection.json` is minted by
#      `full_master_ranking`, then re-ordered by `selection_order_sanitize`).
#   2. Otherwise the ownership catalog, when it names exactly one pipeline
#      stage — covers sidecars with no SSOT row (`preclean/lineage.json`).
#   3. Otherwise none: the artifact is operator-, GUI- or ops-supplied and has

#             posture and branch. Only `_TRANSCRIPT_ALWAYS_PRESENT` qualifies.

# * the three `mastering_research_*` stages are a presence scan — `_probe` walks
#   `FIELD_PROBES` with `ctx.artifact_exists` and writes `status:
#   skipped_or_thin` for whatever is absent. Missing upstream is the expected
#   state at Shape time (W4–W8 are thin by construction, per `SHAPE_CORE_WAVES`).
# * the three Shape stages short-circuit on `soft_gate_enabled()` and fall
#   through a heuristic ladder ending in `forced_sparse_plan`; the `except`
#   arms still write a schema-valid artifact.
#
# So a hard dep on research/Shape would gate a stage that is built never to be
# gated — `artifact_lifecycle.run_phase_checks` would refuse PRESTAGE on a tape
# where the stage is designed to produce a thin-but-valid artifact.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# plan_rank — coverage, narrative, ranking, layups, air contract, transitions
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hardness SSOT for ranking is `stage_input_checks._check_full_master_ranking`
# (FMR-B1). Other plan_rank stages still track `llm_preflight`:
#
#   narrative_arc_plan   <- master/coverage_audit.json
#   full_master_ranking  <- narrative_plan + manifest + gap_report
#   transitions          <- master/selection.json
#
# `topic_coverage_audit` runs `_preflight_pre_delivery`, which asserts every
# `ANALYSIS_READY_ARTIFACT_PATHS` entry is `complete` — a *status* test, not an
# existence test. A hard contract dep is an existence test that additionally
# arms `artifact_lifecycle.read_stale_guard`, so promoting those to hard would
# add a refusal the stage does not have today. They stay soft.
#
# This group is where read-modify-write is the norm rather than the exception:
# `master/selection.json` is minted by `full_master_ranking` and then rewritten
# by `selection_order_sanitize`, `mastering/mastering_plan.json` by four air
# stages, `understanding/gap_report.json` by three, and
# `connector_fuse_pass_pre_ranking` re-fuses `segments/manifest.json` in place.
# Every one of those is declared as input AND output; see the module docstring
# of `tests/test_contract_input_declaration_safety.py` for why omitting the
# input strands the stage.
