"""Documents derived from the selection follow every selection commit.

The selection (``master/selection.json``) is the air order. Several documents
are derived from it and key on its ids or its order-lock revision: the nugget
lay-up plan copies both, the sound design plan anchors cues on segment ids,
the narrative plan carries ordering constraints over them, and the episode
structure orders them (ISSUES 115 added the last two). Until ISSUES 113 nothing reconciled them when the selection changed
under a seat freeze. A removal that the constitution permitted (an overlap
union retiring an absorbed id, a junction omit, a remap) bumped the selection
revision and left the lay-up plan one revision behind with a retired id in
it; the EDL loader then failed closed on the stale plan, and the heal that
re-fits the plan was refused because it wrote under its own key rather than
the plan owner's. Every run that hit an overlap union under hard freeze
stopped there.

This module is the one place that reconciliation happens, called from the
selection's single write point right after the write. It is deterministic
and never widens the air order: it drops or re-anchors references to ids the
commit already removed, and copies the committed order lock. Writes land
under each document's owner key, with the End-A reason
``selection_dependents_reconcile`` under freeze: paperwork for a removal the
constitution already allowed, never a new seat.
